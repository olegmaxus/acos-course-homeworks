# ACOS Workshops' solutions
Solutions of the ACOS Workshops' problems by Oleg M.
## Notes on the 3d WS
//The first and second tasks are skipped as trivial, since they only required to become used to basics of RISC-V assembler

//Tasks have been done in order, presented on the DSBA ACOS course site

//Each task (from 3rd to 11th) are presented in this repository in .asm extension


//In case of any questions, remarks, additions, please contact me via telegram: @olegmaxus
## Notes on the 4th WS
//No special notes
## Notes on the 5th WS
//In the second task the array has been implemented using stack (.space directive), elements are stored in memory in reverse order

//In the third task exception for zero division was added

//In the last task case 0^0 gives 1 (python-like explicit definition)

## Notes on the 6th WS
//The first two tasks required me to translate C code into risc-v assembly code

//I have done it two ways: by hand (my own translation), and using risc-v toolchain through linux command line (shell):
```console
acos@acos-vm:~/Desktop/acos_materaials$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc sample_name.c -S
```

## Notes on the 7th WS
//The 'no_dups.s' task was quite hard to implement

//There may be a prettier implementation of fprint2.s, using bit shifts, that is less bit_print loops are used

## Notes on the 3rd OSSP WS
// C-tasks are located in WS3_C subfolder

## Notes on the 4th OSSP WS
 <ins>*Part 1*</ins>
 
// Note: original_[static/dynamic].sh are for Task 1 in Part 1, improved_[static/dynamic].sh are for Homework Task 2, where we have to improve original Task

// I have added bash files (.sh) with linux shell for simplicity

// In CMD_EXAMPLE.txt you may find the sequence of console commands, which will give access for .sh files to be executed

// Please, before executing my .sh files, make sure that all the bash files, as well as all function files (fred.c, etc.) are in same folder

// Please, reach me out in telegram in case, there are some issues with execution of the bash files, i provided

// P.S.: in order to provide access for a bash file to be executed one may use the following command:
```console
acos@acos-vm:~/Desktop/acos_materaials/OSSP_WS4$ chmod u+x bash_name.sh
acos@acos-vm:~/Desktop/acos_materaials/OSSP_WS4$ ./bash_name.sh
```
